Hand Gesture Recognition System
This project is a hand gesture recognition system implemented in Python using the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries. The system is capable of recognizing and interpreting various hand gestures such as "yo," "awesome," "peace," "stop" and more.

Description
The Hand Gesture Recognition System utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and analyze hand movements in real-time video input. It leverages the power of OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to extract hand landmarks and track their positions. These landmarks are then used to recognize specific hand gestures and perform corresponding actions or provide relevant feedback.

Features
Real-time hand gesture recognition: The system can detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time, providing instantaneous feedback.
Multiple gesture recognition: It supports a range of hand gestures, including "yo," "awesome," "peace," "stop," and more. Additional gestures can be added easily.
Hand landmark detection: The system employs Mediapipe library to extract hand landmarks accurately, allowing precise gesture recognition.
User-defined actions: Each recognized gesture can trigger a specific action or perform a desired function based on the application requirements.
Easy integration: The system is implemented in Python, making it compatible with various platforms and easy to integrate into existing projects.
Requirements
Python (version >= 3.x)
OpenCV (version >= 4.x)
Mediapipe (version >= 0.8.7)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd hand-gesture-recognition

Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script:

python main.py

The system will start capturing video from the default camera and display the real-time hand gesture recognition output.

Perform different hand gestures within the camera frame, and the system will recognize and display the recognized gesture on the screen.

Customize the actions associated with each gesture in the code as per your requirements.
